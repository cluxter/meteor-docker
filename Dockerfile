# This script will install the Meteor binary installer (called the launchpad) in /usr/local and consequently requires to be root.
# Then, when we will run the "meteor" command later on for the first time, it will call the launchpad that will copy the Meteor binaries in ~/.meteor.
# This way every user can run Meteor under the user space.

# We now add a "meteor" user that will be used to avoid running Meteor with root privileges.

# We switch to the "meteor" account.

# We call the "meteor" command for the first time which will install the Meteor binaries in ~/.meteor.

# We create a dedicated folder in which the app will be copied.
ONBUILD RUN cd /home/meteor && mkdir app

# We copy the app in the said folder.

# Since "COPY" ignores the "USER" command, files were copied as root. So we need to go back to the root account...
ONBUILD USER root

# ...change all the file permissions of the app to "meteor:meteor"...
ONBUILD RUN chown -R meteor:meteor /home/meteor/app

# ...clean the Meteor cache for a clean image...
ONBUILD RUN rm -rf /home/meteor/app/.meteor/local/*

# ...and go back to the "meteor" account again so Meteor will run as the "meteor" user.

# When we will run the image of our app, we simply want to run the "meteor" command.
# Consequently all the data will be kept in the current container of our app and will be destroyed when the container will be removed.
